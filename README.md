## What is Dose of Colorado?

This is a place to get your own small dose of the Rocky Mountains. Yes, you can literally get a small piece of Colorado to have as your very own, to do with as you please.  

### But wait, there's more!

Not only can you have your dose, you can learn more about it too! Just go to https://my.doseofcolorado.com and enter your myDoC ID to see:
- The exact date, time, and position on Earth where your dose was collected
- Photos & video of the location
- Notable notes about the collection of your dose

*Note: use myDoC ID "alpha" to see a demo*
